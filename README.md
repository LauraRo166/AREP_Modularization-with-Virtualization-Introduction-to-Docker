# Modularization with Virtualization - Introduction to Docker

This project demonstrates the deployment of a simple web application using Java, 
Maven, Docker, and AWS EC2. The application provides a minimal REST API built in Java, 
which is containerized with Docker and pushed to Docker Hub. Finally, the container is 
deployed and tested on an AWS EC2 instance, showing the complete workflow from local 
development to cloud deployment and serving as a practical exercise to understand 
containerization, image publishing, and cloud deployment of Java applications.

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LauraRo166/AREP_Modularization-with-Virtualization-Introduction-to-Docker.git
   cd AREP_Modularization-with-Virtualization-Introduction-to-Docker
   ```

2. Make sure you have Java 17+, Maven and Docker installed:

   ```bash
   java -version
   mvn -version
   docker -v
   ```
3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Run the following command to run the project:

   ```bash
    java -cp "target/classes;target/dependency/*" co.edu.escuelaing.dockeraws.DockerAWS
    ```

2. The server will listen on port 5000, you can open your browser and try the index file with:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

<img width="991" height="501" alt="Arquitectura" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75528f88-9c03-4302-b5be-9a7cf7858360" />

The system is deployed on an Amazon EC2 virtual machine and encapsulated within a Docker container, ensuring portability and ease of deployment.

**1. Client:**
The end user interacts with the application through a web browser, sending HTTP requests to the server.

**2. Browser**
The client‚Äôs browser manages the static resources it receives from the server, such as HTML, JavaScript, and JPG files. These resources form the interface with which the user interacts.

**3. Backend (Docker container on EC2)**
On the server side, the web application runs inside the Docker container.

 - The main component is the HttpServer, which handles all incoming HTTP requests.

The HttpServer can:
    
- Serve static files (HTML, JS, images) through the StaticFiles module.
- Delegate dynamic requests to the RestController.

The RestController processes business logic requests and uses Annotations to route methods and properly handle responses.

## üîåConcurrency and Graceful Shutdown 
The application implements a graceful shutdown mechanism to ensure that the server does not 
terminate abruptly when the container or process is stopped. This mechanism is handled through
a shutdown hook registered in the Java runtime. When the application receives a termination 
signal (e.g., SIGTERM when executing docker stop), the shutdown hook is triggered.

At that moment, the server stops accepting new incoming connections and properly terminates 
ongoing requests. Once all resources are released and the execution flow is safely completed, 
the server shuts down.

This approach ensures that the system avoids data loss, incomplete responses, or corrupted 
states, while also making the application behave predictably inside a Docker container or any 
managed environment.

````java
    /**
     * Starts the HTTP server, listening on port 35000. This method accepts
     * incoming connections, parses requests, and dispatches them either to a

     * static files from the "webroot" directory.
     *
     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs while handling client
     * connections.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Deployment

The dockerfile is created in the root directory with the following content:

```
FROM openjdk:17
 
WORKDIR /usrapp/bin
 
ENV PORT=6000
 
COPY /target/classes /usrapp/bin/classes
COPY /target/dependency /usrapp/bin/dependency
 
CMD ["java","-cp","./classes:./dependency/*","co.edu.escuelaing.dockeraws.DockerAWS"]
```

and the same goes for the docker-compose.yml file:

```
services:
  web:
    build:
        context: .
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: web
    ports:
        - "8087:6000"
  db:
    image: mongo:8-noble
    container_name: db
    volumes:
        - mongodb:/data/db
        - mongodb_config:/data/configdb
    ports:
        - 27017:27017
    command: mongod
 
volumes:
  mongodb:
  mongodb_config:  

```

We build the image with the command
```bash
docker build --tag dockeraws .
```

<img width="921" height="392" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8dfd0b0-1840-42fc-9976-a9b59ae1c9d2" />

From the image created, create three instances of a docker container.
```bash
docker run -d -p 34000:6000 --name firstdockercontainer dockeraws
docker run -d -p 34001:6000 --name firstdockercontainer2 dockeraws
docker run -d -p 34002:6000 --name firstdockercontainer3 dockeraws
```

<img width="921" height="143" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75939a82-a547-4855-913f-b9ce94533b2a" />

We can verify its correct creation with
```bash
docker ps .
```

<img width="921" height="152" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38b40e9a-859f-4cf9-a532-950c10d8f7ee" />

And we can test by accessing to
```
http://localhost:34001/
```
We run docker compose with
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

<img width="921" height="812" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14251f8b-3bea-491b-af13-813ab8ca67e5" />

A repository is created on DockerHub.

<img width="921" height="180" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a709dcf0-6685-472b-866a-e0db84ee0b69" />

and we execute:
```bash
docker tag dockeraws lauraro/arep20252
docker login
docker push lauraro/arep20252:latest
```

<img width="921" height="514" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f977a4c0-2e85-4be8-8e7a-31d5982e8c19" />


<img width="921" height="438" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48ca1256-6150-446c-b60a-756bb814c2e0" />

Now we create the EC2 instance in AWS, access the machine and run:
```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install docker
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```

Reboot to apply changes and execute:
```bash
docker run -d -p 42000:6000 --name dockeraws lauraro/arep20252
```

And now you can try accessing from a browser with the machine's DNS, 
for example:
```
http://ec2-54-198-75-226.compute-1.amazonaws.com:42000/```
```

## ‚úÖ Evaluation (Tests)

### Unit tests
Unit tests were created using JUnit to validate the server‚Äôs functionality:

To run the tests:

   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

Should look something like this:

<img width="921" height="280" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57066d6e-1135-4070-a1b5-17a625f6804e" />
